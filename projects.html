            <div class="box"><h2>Minecraft Server</h2><h4>
                I took an old computer, installed Ubuntu on it, and installed Minecraft Server on it.
                I then opened a specific port on my home router, and was able to play Minecraft with
                my friends from afar using a locally hosted server.

            <div class="box"><h2>Batocera Machine</h2><h4>
                I was given an old laptop by my dad. I installed a specific linux distro to it called
                Batocera, an emulation-based distro that uses EmulationStation as a base to play retro
                games. I connected my old PS3 controllers to the laptop, and was able to play these games
                on my TV through an HDMI cable.

            <div class="box"><h2>Intro to Networking II Case Study</h2><h4>
                Using Cisco Packet Tracer, I successfully set up a topology of routers, switches, and end devices
                using various protocols such as BGP, OSPF, and using IP routing. I had done the entire project
                by myself in one night, as I was forced to after I missed the deadline to join a group.
            </h4></div>
            <div class="box"><h2>Asteroids Remake</h2><h4>
                With two of my friends, we used Unity to develop a clone of the 1979 Atari arcade game Asteroids.
                We programmed the entire game in C#, developing our own sprites from scratch. We were able to
                add the screen wraparound, the inertia, and collision.
